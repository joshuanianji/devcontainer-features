## Requirements

This feature assumes you have the `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli` feature installed as well. 

## OS/Architecture Support

This Feature should work on recent versions of Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions. Github actions uses `amd` architecture to test it, but it should work with `arm` based architectures as well.
